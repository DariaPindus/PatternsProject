# Patterns Project
This is a project to learn closer 3 widely-used patterns:
* Decorator 
* Command
* Template Method

## Chosen abstraction
To bring sense to this example an abstraction for this project was chosen - modeling work of web-studio on creating web-site.

"Command" is responsible for the stages of project creation, such as requirements analysis, design, implementation and testing; <br />
"Decorator" representes designers' supported knowledges (such as knowledge of CMS frameworks or knowledge of front-end technologies (PHP, jQuery, etc.)), <br />
"Template method" is an algorithm for performing the main task of a command.
